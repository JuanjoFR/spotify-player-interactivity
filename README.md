# Spotify Player Interactivity

Project created as a practice to develop an interactivity similar to the one used by Spotify in its app to show/hide the player using [React Native Gesture Handler] and [Reanimated] (v2 in both cases).

The main idea came to me while studying the video [Spotify Player - "Can it be done in React Native?"] from [wcandillon], but with the latest versions of RNGH and Reanimated.

One of the best ways to learn and improve is by sharing knowledge, so you can use this project to study and improve. I hope you find it useful!

Thanks to [wcandillon] for his unvaluable videos.
